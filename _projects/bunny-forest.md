# Bunny Forest

Calm and cute pixel game about bunnies. Hop around, search for carrots, plant flowers, trade and explore the forest.

There are 6 areas to explore and you'll have to work a bit to get into the last 2. There are some  secrets too!🐰

If you ever get stuck because you can't find enough food (it might be hiding behind something), don't worry - any carrots, apples, and pumpkins you eat will regrow in an hour. You don't need to keep the game open either - time passes even while it's closed.
